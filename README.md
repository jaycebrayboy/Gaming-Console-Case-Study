A gaming shop has collected historical sales data about discontinued consoles in order to set prices and help prioritize which ones to repair. 



Printed the output so that each element is left-aligned and has a fixed string length of 20 characters.

Used list indexing to print out the row containing data about the Sega CD. Then, on another line, I used indexing again to print out the number of Game Boy consoles that were sold over its lifetime.
